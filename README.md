# Linux STL Containers

I've recently been learning Linux 2.6.24, which is very old, but teaches me a lot.

This repository mainly documents my implementation of the Linux 2.6.24 standard containers, and is intended to be used for learning purposes only.

Note that these containers are built with **LIBC**.
